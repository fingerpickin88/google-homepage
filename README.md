Creating this page took some time. I had to start over once, because I forgot to link the .css file, and was getting frustrated none of my elements were moving around!

I also had to redo the <footer> element, and still am having trouble understanding when to use float, and when to use display and position.

Finally, I was able to had one <i> element. I went to add more, but felt I was spending too much time creating this page. The instructions said do not worry about maing it perfect, and so, I am moving on!
